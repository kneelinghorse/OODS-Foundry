## Showcase Gallery

Brand proofs are curated as pre-set galleries. The showcase view renders the light, dark, and high-contrast
contracts together so changes surface across modes in a single glance.

  <Story of={BrandAStories.Showcase} />

Brand A extends the base token stack without touching component logic. Each theme swap happens via
`data-brand="A"` combined with the relevant `data-theme` attribute so React trees stay token-only.

## Light Theme

Warm neutrals and accent ramps map onto the existing `--cmp-*` slots while maintaining 4.5:1 button contrast.

  <Story of={BrandAStories.Light} />

## Dark Theme

Deep umber surfaces and luminous accents cascade through the same component slotsâ€”no conditionals in JSX.

  <Story of={BrandAStories.Dark} />

## High Contrast

The high-contrast mode leans on system colors (`Canvas`, `Highlight`) so OS palettes drive accessibility.

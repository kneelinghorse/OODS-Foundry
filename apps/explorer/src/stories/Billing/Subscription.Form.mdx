### Highlights

- Toolbar status chips reference the same token manifest while provider details hydrate the inputs.
- Form shell relies on context classes to manage spacing; every control stays token based (`--cmp-*`).
- Fields bind directly to normalized subscription data so legal, finance, and success see aligned copy.

MDX content below shares how the list stays pure while tokens and mapping drive parity.

### Why it matters

- Canonical subscription statuses map to the same badge tone for Stripe and Chargebee.
- Renewal metrics use normalized amounts; the story performs no provider specific branching.
- Context classes (`context-list`) keep spacing and typography consistent with other list views.

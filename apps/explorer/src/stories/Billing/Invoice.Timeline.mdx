### Observations

- Timeline chips stay in sync with the unified status map; `nextStatus` alone determines tone.
- JSON scenarios cover on-time, retry, and refund paths without any provider conditionals.
- The shared timeline scaffold continues to serve every domain context with no extra layout overrides.

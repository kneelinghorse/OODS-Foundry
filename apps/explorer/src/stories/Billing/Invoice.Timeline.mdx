{`### Observations

- Timeline chips stay in sync with the unified status mapâ€”no provider specific CSS.
- Events derive directly from canonical timestamps (issued, due, reminder) without branching logic.
- The timeline scaffold remains the same component tree Storybook already ships for other domains.

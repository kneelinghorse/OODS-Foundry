{`### Highlights

- Collector contact, credit memo, notification, and dunning groups share tone-driven FieldGroup styling for clarity.
- ValidationBanner escalates blocking states with proper alert/live-region defaults for retrying invoices.
- Disabled stage fields demonstrate read-only governance without diverging from the tokens-only surface.

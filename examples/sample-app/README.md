# OODS Trait Engine Sample App

This minimal app is exercised by `pnpm run pkg:compat` to confirm that the
packaged `@oods/trait-engine` bundle installs cleanly, renders React components,
and exposes provenance metadata required by internal workflows.

The smoke script renders a `PageHeader` server-side and prints the embedded
Storybook and visual-regression identifiers.

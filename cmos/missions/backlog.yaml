context: 'This orchestrator drives the program: each sprint contains missions sized
  to single-agent sessions.

  The backlog is the single source of truth for statuses, file links, and dependencies.

  Status flow: Queued → Current → In Progress → Completed (Blocked when needed).

  Research lives in cmos/missions/research/.

  Sprint missions live in cmos/missions/sprint-XX/NN.N_mission-name.yaml.

  Agents update PROJECT_CONTEXT.json and append events to SESSIONS.jsonl.

sprints:
  sprints: *id002
successCriteria:
- 'Sprints/missions flow: Queued → Current → In Progress → Completed (Blocked when
  needed).'
- Backlog is the single source of truth for statuses, links, and dependencies.
- No schema-breaking changes to prior sprints.
successMetrics:
- 'Representative system: dual-brand surfaces render accurately with no brand-bleed.'
- Statusables & inputs/tables reuse enum→token mapping; no literal colors; AA/HC pass.
- VR green on curated cross-brand stories; per-brand baselines managed.
- Coverage regained to thresholds; basic component/e2e tests exist for new surfaces.
- Token governance reports clean (or justified) across both brands.
- Onboarding quickstarts verified ≤10 minutes on a clean clone; local PR check script
  exits non-zero on failures.

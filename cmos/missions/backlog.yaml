      completed_at: '2025-12-03T14:52:52Z'
      notes: 'Fixed responsive layout issue in VizContainer:


        CHANGES MADE:

        1. Removed 2-column layout (lg:grid-cols-[minmax(0,2fr)_minmax(0,1fr)]) that
        was squeezing charts at larger breakpoints

        2. Changed to single-column grid layout (grid gap-6) so charts get full width

        3. Added min-w-0 w-full overflow-hidden to section element for proper width
        containment

        4. Added conditional rendering - description/fallback container only renders
        if content exists


        VERIFICATION:

        - TypeScript compiles without errors

        - All 31 viz component tests pass (6 test files)

        - Pattern gallery stories (Patterns.stories.tsx, PatternGalleryV2.stories.tsx)
        use chart components that now render properly


        The fix addresses the core issue: charts were being squeezed to 2/3 width
        at lg+ breakpoints due to the grid layout reserving 1/3 for description/fallback,
        even when those areas were empty.'

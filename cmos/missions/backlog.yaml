      notes: '- Added Intro/Welcome landing (apps/explorer/.storybook/Intro.mdx) and
        documented nav order while pinning the manager panel to the right.

        - Toolbar brand/theme globals are fixed; Chromatic still runs multi-brand
        coverage and docs/storybook/display-decisions.md records the policy + rationale.

        - Token Browser + Swatch now render semantic colours, redundant Elements Smoke
        story was removed, and EmptyState illustration contrast improved.

        - Dark-mode docs gained the .docs-dark-surface container so the demo stays
        legible without mutating document-level data-theme.

        - Validation: pnpm vitest run tests/components/empty-state.spec.tsx; pnpm
        build-storybook; ./cmos/cli.py validate docs; ./cmos/cli.py validate health.'

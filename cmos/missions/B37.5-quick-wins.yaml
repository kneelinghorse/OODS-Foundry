id: B37.5
title: Quick Wins
status: Queued
sprint: Sprint 37
created: 2025-12-03
tags: [cleanup, polish, tooltip, quick-wins]

objective: |
  Complete quick cleanup tasks that improve the codebase without major effort.
  These are small wins identified during planning that don't warrant full missions.

context: |
  From navigation audit and planning session, several small items surfaced:

  1. Tooltip component exists but has no story
  2. Explorer stories were excluded from nav but may need verification
  3. Any issues found in B37.1 verification that are minor

  This mission collects small tasks that can be batched together.

deliverables:
  - path: stories/primitives/Tooltip.stories.tsx
    action: create
    details: |
      Create a Tooltip story for the existing component.

      Component location: src/components/Tooltip/

      Story structure:
      ```typescript
      // stories/primitives/Tooltip.stories.tsx

      import { Tooltip } from '~/src/components/Tooltip';

      export default {
        title: 'Primitives/Feedback/Tooltip',
        component: Tooltip,
      };

      export const Default: Story = {
        args: {
          content: 'Helpful information',
          children: <button>Hover me</button>,
        },
      };

      export const Positions: Story = {
        // Show top, bottom, left, right positions
      };

      export const WithDelay: Story = {
        // Show timing configuration
      };

      export const Accessibility: Story = {
        // Show aria-describedby behavior
      };
      ```

      Include docs showing:
      - Basic usage
      - Position options
      - Timing configuration
      - Accessibility considerations (described-by)

  - path: .storybook/main.ts
    action: verify
    details: |
      Verify Explorer stories are properly excluded.

      After B36.1, Explorer stories should not appear in main nav.

      CHECK:
      1. Open Storybook
      2. Search for "Explorer" in nav
      3. Confirm no Explorer-specific stories appear

      If issues found, update the stories array to ensure exclusion.

  - path: cmos/reports/sprint-37-verification.md
    action: update
    details: |
      Address any minor issues found in B37.1 verification.

      Common fixes might include:
      - Story title typos
      - Missing imports
      - Broken links in MDX
      - Linting warnings

      Document fixes applied.

success_criteria:
  - Tooltip.stories.tsx exists and renders correctly
  - Explorer stories confirmed excluded from nav
  - Any B37.1 minor issues resolved
  - Verification report updated with fixes

validation:
  - command: pnpm storybook --smoke-test
    expected: All stories load
  - manual: Navigate to Primitives/Feedback/Tooltip
  - manual: Confirm Explorer stories not in nav
  - manual: Verify B37.1 issues addressed

dependencies:
  - B37.1 (provides list of minor issues to fix)

estimated_effort: 1-2 hours

notes: |
  This is a catch-all mission for small tasks.

  If during Sprint 37 execution other small issues surface,
  they can be added to this mission rather than creating new ones.

  SCOPE GUARD: Only truly small tasks belong here.
  Anything >1 hour should be a separate mission.

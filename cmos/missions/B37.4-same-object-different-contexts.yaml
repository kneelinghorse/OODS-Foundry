title: Same Object Different Contexts
status: Queued
sprint: Sprint 37
created: 2025-12-03
tags: [hero-demo, contexts, user, navigation-phase-2]

objective: |
  Create a dedicated "Same Object, Different Contexts" hero demo showing
  the User object rendered in all 8 contexts side-by-side. This is the
  clearest "aha moment" for understanding OODS's context-aware rendering.

context: |
  INFRASTRUCTURE AUDIT FINDINGS:

  1. RenderObject supports 6 contexts:
     detail, list, form, timeline, card, inline

  2. Chart and Dashboard contexts also exist (8 total):
     chart, dashboard

  3. Context Gallery (stories/proofs/context-gallery.stories.tsx) shows
     multiple objects × contexts, but doesn't focus on the "same object"
     insight with annotations.

  THIS STORY FOCUSES ON ONE OBJECT (User) ACROSS ALL CONTEXTS
  with clear annotations explaining what changes between each.

      Create a focused demo showing User in all contexts:

      ```typescript
      // stories/contexts/SameObjectDifferentContexts.stories.tsx

      import { RenderObject } from '~/src/components/RenderObject';
      import { UserObject } from '~/src/objects/user/object';
      import activeUser from '~/src/fixtures/user/active.json';

      // Single story showing User in all 8 contexts
      export const UserInAllContexts: Story = {
        render: () => (
          <div className="context-comparison-grid">
            {/* Each context in a labeled section */}
            <ContextPanel context="detail" label="Detail View">
              <p className="context-description">
                Full information display. Shows all traits, expanded fields.
              </p>
              <RenderObject object={UserObject} context="detail" data={activeUser} />
            </ContextPanel>

            <ContextPanel context="list" label="List View">
              <p className="context-description">
                Compact row format. Key fields only, optimized for scanning.
              </p>
              <RenderObject object={UserObject} context="list" data={activeUser} />
            </ContextPanel>

            {/* ... form, timeline, card, inline, chart, dashboard */}
          </div>
        ),
      };
      ```

      LAYOUT:
      - 2×4 or 4×2 grid (responsive)
      - Each cell: label + description + rendered object
      - Clear visual separation between contexts

      ANNOTATIONS (key teaching content):
      - Detail: "Full information display. Shows all traits."
      - List: "Compact row format. Key fields only."
      - Form: "Editable fields. Validation states visible."
      - Timeline: "Activity-focused. Events and timestamps."
      - Card: "Self-contained summary. Suitable for grids."
      - Inline: "Minimal footprint. For embedding in text."
      - Chart: "Data visualization context."
      - Dashboard: "Widget-optimized. Key metrics prominent."

      STORY TITLE: "Contexts/Same Object, Different Contexts"

success_criteria:
  - User object renders correctly in all 8 contexts
  - Each context has clear label and description
  - Layout is responsive and scannable
  - Annotations explain the purpose of each context
  - Appears prominently under "Contexts" section

validation:
  - command: pnpm storybook --smoke-test
    expected: Story loads without errors
  - manual: Navigate to Contexts section
  - manual: Verify all 8 context panels render
  - manual: Verify annotations are clear and helpful

dependencies:
  - B37.1 (verification)
  - B37.2 (builds on Object Matrix learnings)

estimated_effort: 2 hours

notes: |
  This is distinct from the Object Matrix (B37.2):
  - Object Matrix: Multiple objects × few contexts (breadth)
  - This story: One object × all contexts (depth)

  Together they prove OODS's two key insights:
  1. Same object → different contexts → different renderings
  2. Different objects → same context → consistent patterns

  The annotations are the teaching content - don't skip them.
  They help users understand WHY each context exists.

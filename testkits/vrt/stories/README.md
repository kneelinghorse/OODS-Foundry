# Playwright Fallback Stories

This directory is intentionally left empty. When activating the Playwright + Storycap fallback harness, drop ad-hoc Playwright specs here (e.g., to pilot new capture flows) or let `npx test-storybook` emit compiled tests that reference Storybook stories.

Chromatic remains the primary visual regression gate; keep this directory clean unless the fallback path is enabled.

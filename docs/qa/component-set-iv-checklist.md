## Visual Regression Testing

### Storybook Build

**Status:** ✅ Built successfully (5.84s)
**Output:** `/storybook-static`
**Bundle Size:** Within acceptable limits

### Chromatic Integration

**Status:** ✅ Baselines refreshed (20 snapshots, 0 diffs)
**Artifact:** `artifacts/state/chromatic.json`
**Coverage:** All Component Set IV stories included (light/dark for brands A & B)
**Themes:** Light, Dark configured
**HC Mode:** Documented as manual verification (forced-colors not auto-captured)

**Recommendation:** Keep forced-colors evaluation manual until Storycap fallback ships; continue tagging new variants with `vrt-critical`.

---

## Unit Test Coverage

**Test Suite:** ✅ 754/754 tests passing (7.28s)
**Test Framework:** Vitest with jsdom
**Coverage Target:** 90%+ (met)

### Component Test Details

| Component | Test File | Tests | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| Progress | progress.test.tsx | 33 | 95%+ | PASS |
| Stepper | stepper.test.tsx | included | 95%+ | PASS |
| Tabs | tabs.spec.tsx | 24 | 93%+ | PASS |
| Pagination | pagination.spec.tsx | 33 | 96%+ | PASS |
| Breadcrumbs | breadcrumbs.spec.tsx | 32 | 94%+ | PASS |
| EmptyState | empty-state.spec.tsx | 12 | 92%+ | PASS |
| Toast | toast.spec.tsx | 17 | 91%+ | PASS |

**Notes:**
- Toast tests include act() warnings (non-blocking, cosmetic)
- All component behaviors verified
- Edge cases covered (overflow, truncation, empty states)

---

## Documentation Review

### Storybook Stories

All components have comprehensive Storybook stories covering:

✅ **Primary/Default stories** - Basic usage examples
✅ **Size variants** - sm/md/lg where applicable (Tabs, Pagination, Progress)
✅ **Intent/Status variants** - info/success/warning/critical (EmptyState, Toast, Progress)
✅ **State demonstrations** - active, disabled, loading, error
✅ **Responsive behaviors** - Overflow menus, mobile collapse
✅ **Accessibility proofs** - Keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### API Documentation

✅ **TypeScript definitions** - All props typed and exported
✅ **JSDoc comments** - Component headers with usage examples
✅ **Token references** - Design token usage documented
✅ **Accessibility guidance** - ARIA patterns and keyboard shortcuts

### Missing/Incomplete Items

⚠️ **Minor gaps identified:**
1. Toast component: act() warnings in tests (cosmetic, non-blocking)
2. Breadcrumbs: Overflow menu tooltip timing could be documented
3. Tabs: Truncation behavior edge cases could use more examples

**Action:** Log as post-packaging improvements (non-critical)

---

## Sprint 18 Issues Triage

### Open Issues

**Status:** ✅ No critical issues blocking packaging

### Closed Issues

- ✅ Progress component token hook implementation
- ✅ Tabs overflow menu keyboard navigation
- ✅ Pagination usePagination hook truncation logic
- ✅ Breadcrumbs aria-current implementation
- ✅ EmptyState intent mapping to Statusables
- ✅ Toast queue management and positioning

---

## Design Sign-Off

**Design Review:** ✅ APPROVED
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Reviewer:** Design System Team

**Comments:**
- Component Set IV aligns with design specifications
- Token usage consistent across all components
- Intent-based status mapping correctly implemented
- High-contrast resilience verified
- Ready for packaging and external review

---

## Findings & Follow-Up

### Critical (Must Fix Before Packaging)

**None** ✅

### High Priority (Address in Sprint 19)

**None** ✅

### Medium Priority (Post-Packaging)

1. **Toast act() warnings** - Wrap state updates in act() for cleaner test output
2. **Documentation expansion** - Add more edge case examples for complex components (Tabs, Breadcrumbs)
3. **Performance profiling** - Validate large dataset rendering (100+ tabs, pagination)

### Low Priority (Backlog)

1. **Storybook controls** - Add more interactive controls for experimentation
2. **Animation timing** - Document reduced-motion behavior per component
3. **Token browser integration** - Link components to token browser for discoverability

# MCP Contracts

Strong schemas back every MCP tool so agents and operators can trust payloads at compile time and at runtime. This guide captures the new schemaâ†’type pipeline, validation hooks, and how to keep the contracts tight.

## Schema-Driven Types
- JSON Schemas live under `packages/mcp-server/src/schemas/`.
- Run `pnpm --filter @oods/mcp-server run generate:types` to regenerate TypeScript definitions in `src/schemas/generated.ts`.
- `pnpm --filter @oods/mcp-server run build` now performs `generate:types --check` to fail fast when schemas and generated types diverge.
- Use the generator before committing any schema edits; never edit `generated.ts` by hand.

## Runtime Validation
- `packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts` registers every tool with explicit input/output schema pairs.
- Handlers are invoked only after Ajv validates the payloads. Any schema drift is surfaced as a structured MCP error before handlers run.
- The Fastify health endpoint lists registered tools so clients can introspect available contracts.

## Contract Tests
- Contract specs live at `packages/mcp-server/test/contracts/schema.contract.spec.ts`.
- Tests compile schemas with Ajv, assert that canonical payloads satisfy the schema and TypeScript types, and include deliberate negative controls.
- Execute `pnpm --filter @oods/mcp-server exec vitest run test/contracts/schema.contract.spec.ts` (or `pnpm --filter @oods/mcp-server run test:contracts` if already configured) to exercise the suite.

Keeping schemas authoritative means every public surface is strongly typed, drift is caught at build, and regressions fail fast in CI.

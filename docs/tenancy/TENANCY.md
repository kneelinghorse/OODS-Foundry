# Multi-Tenancy Architecture

ðŸšš &nbsp;This guide now lives at [`Docs/TENANCY.md`](../../Docs/TENANCY.md).

Use that canonical document for up-to-date architecture diagrams, configuration guidance, and migration playbooks. The supporting quick-start material remains in this folder (`README.md`) for day-to-day reference.
